# Deploying Nethermind Lodestar Client on Ubuntu 20.04

This README provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Nethermind Lodestar client on a Ubuntu 20.04 machine. Nethermind is an Ethereum client implementation, and Lodestar is an Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain client.

**Note:** Ensure that you have administrative privileges or sudo access on your Ubuntu 20.04 server.

## Step 1: Update and Upgrade

Start by updating the package list and upgrading installed packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

## Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

You'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to run Lodestar. Install them using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

## Step 3: Clone the Lodestar Repository

Clone the Lodestar repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar.git
```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies and Build Lodestar

Navigate to the Lodestar directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd lodestar
npm install
